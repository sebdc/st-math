# Description
A Python application deployed that calculates definite integrals using the midpoint rule. The app takes a user-provided mathematical expression, integration bounds, and the number of subintervals. It then numerically integrates the function using the midpoint rule algorithm and generates a visual representation of the function along with the midpoint rule approximation. The results are presented in a plot, and the application is designed to be accessible via a web interface.
